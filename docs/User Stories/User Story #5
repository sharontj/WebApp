User Story #5 - Update User Preferences

Goal: 
As a signed in user (see User Story #2) I should be able to update my preferences, like adding my favorite non-Steam games
or removing games entered from my Steam account that I don’t care about, so that I can better tailor my 
feed to have items important to me and so that I can control what is displayed on my profile.

Requirements:
If a user wants to update their preferences so as to improve the content recommended to them by the app, they can 
edit their preferences by clicking the settings button under their displayed name. The user should also be able to 
update/edit any entered preferences entered when they originally signed-up (including adding and deleting preferences). 
If a user has no preferences or games they are specifically interested in then the website should display information about
the most popular content. If a user connected their Steam account to their profile, games from Steam should be added based 
on a user’s favorites, most played, recently played, wishlist and more. The user would also be able to edit which information 
from Steam they care about. In order to apply the updated preferences, the user should hit the save before before exiting the
preferences page. If the connection gets interrupted while editing this page and the user has not yet clicked save, the 
preferences will not be updated.
