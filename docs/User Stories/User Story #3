User Story #3 - Browse the Feed (Main Use Case)

Goal:
As a signed in user (refer to User Story #2) I want to be able to browse my feed so that I can 
easily view gaming content that interests me. 

Requirements:
Content should be split into sections by content type (streams, articles, esports events/updates, 
upcoming games, patches, etc), perhaps different tabs refer to different content types. The user should 
be able to scroll through their feed and the items that are most similar to their interests which they enter 
(see User Story #1 and User Story #5) should aggregate at the top. If a user has no preferences or games they 
are specifically interested in then the website should display information about the most popular content. 
There should be thumbnails for videos or images that will play the video or open the image when clicked. 
Articles can be clickable text. If an image or link were to not load properly then that particular item should 
not be shown or replaced with a stock message or image. If clicking a particular link is unable to work then it 
should redirect to an error page. The user should be able to like items in their feed which that then show up 
when a friend (see User Story #4) views their profile.
