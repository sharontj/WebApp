User Story #2 - Sign In

Goal:
User wants to sign in to an existing account on the web app.

Requirements:
Upon visiting the site, the user sees a sign in page. They are given the option to sign in via 
Steam, Google, Twitter, or Facebook, or to enter their own credentials (username and password)
(refer to User Story #1). If the user does not have an account that matches the chosen credentials, 
they will see an error telling them so that recommends they go to the linked sign up page. There 
will also be an option for the user to recover/reset their password if they created their own for 
the app rather than connecting it to an existing account. If the credentials match an existing account, 
they will be logged in. They will see their displayed name (and maybe icon) which they can click to view 
their own profile and their feed (see User Story #3).
