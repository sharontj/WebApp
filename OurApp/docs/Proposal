Assignment 1 - Proposal

Idea #1: Gaming Profile Web App

An web app that acts as an aggregate of various aspects of a user's gaming interests. This would use Steam, 
Twitch, ESPN, and Youtube APIs to gather information and recommend content related to current games the user is playing, 
preferred genres, eSports events, streamers and youtubers making relevant content based on the user's interests. 
Would display both user information/achievements as well as recommendations for new content. Customizable, and would allow 
the user to enter certain preferences about displayed and recommended content. User would login with their 
steam account and make a profile upon first authentication. The use of a database would be necessary to store 
user information/preferences.


Idea #2: How to Spend Your Money

A web app that allows the user to enter a price/price range and then suggest events, restaurants, locations, 
or popular items within the entered price range. This would make user of various APIs, such as EventBrite, Yelp, 
BandsInTown, TicketMaster, Eventful, Facebook Event, Google Calendar, etc. The user could login with either 
Facebook or Gmail (ideally Gmail so we could have access to their Google calendar if they allow it). The user 
could also enter certain preferences to help with recommendations, which we could then use MangoDB to store.
