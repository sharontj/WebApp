User Story #1 - Sign Up

Goal:
User wants to create an account upon visiting the web app for the first time.

Requirements:
When the user goes to the web app for the first time, they are greeted with a minimal sign up page. 
They can sign up with their Steam account, if they have one, or if not, their Google, Twitter, or 
Facebook account, or they can just enter an email and password. Upon account authentication, they 
will be prompted to fill in some profile information in a form. The required fields will include things 
such as name, display name, preferred games, genres, esports teams, professional players, Twitch streamers,
Youtubers, etc. Once they complete the form their profile will be created and their feed updated to 
reflect their entered preferences. The user can view their profile by clicking their name and/or icon in 
the app. The profile will show the userâ€™s gaming interests/preferences, current games, gaming achievements, 
followed/subscribed streamers, recently liked "posts" (refer to User Story #3).
