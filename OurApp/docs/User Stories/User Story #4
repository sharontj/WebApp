User Story #4 - Add Friends

Goal:
As a signed in user, I want to find and add friends so that I can see what games they’re playing 
and what gaming content they’re interested in.

Requirements:
When the user signs in (refer to User Story #2), they will be able to view their friend list by 
clicking the appropriate tab/button in the client. In addition to viewing current friends, the user 
should be able to search for other users by username or full name. If any matches are found, they 
can send an add friend request, if not, they will see a message saying no result found. If the other 
user accepts the request, the two users will be friends with usernames appearing in each other’s friend list. 
For any friend in the friend list, the user should be able to see what that friend is playing if 
their friend is logged in with a steam account. The user should also be able to view their friends 
profile which will show gaming interests/achievements and liked posts. Additionally, this user should be 
able to message (given that this capability can be implemented in time) online friends on their friends list.
